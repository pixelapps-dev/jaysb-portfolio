				<p>Hey there!</p>
				<p>I'm a user interface designer and developer who has been pushing pixels for the past 3 years.</p>
				<p>Iâ€™m a dedicated, adaptable self-starter - continuously working to hone my design skill-set.</p>
				<p>I respect the importance of critical feedback, and am constantly striving to reach the best experience for the customer by methodical planning and validating assumptions based on user data.</p>
				<p>I have a clear, articulate manner and an easy-going, professional personality.</p>
				<p>When I'm not logged on, you'll probably find me outside in the garden, cooking up a feed or off on a mission somewhere around the globe (once this COVID bizzo chills out a bit).</p>
				<p>Give me a shout at <a href="mailto:hi@jaysbrowne.com">hi@jaysbrowne.com</a>.</p>
